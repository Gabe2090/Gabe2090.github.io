### CPSC120

* Lab 10 

Lab 10, Part 3 was my favorite lab throughout the whole semester because it was the very first image that I have ever created. Going into these computer science courses I have never coded before but I have always been intrigued by computers and how they function and opening myself up to try a journey like this has been well worth it, and I have learned quite a bit along the way. But what intrigued me the most during this part of the lab was the Magick::Image class and how it can control the whole data image such as the pixels and without it being initialized your project will not run properly and have the chance of crashing.  

* Lab 2  

Lab 2, Part 2 going into the computer science world was going to be a difficult start due to the lack of knowledge I had within the coding languages available. But being able to complete with the help of my partner, a whole coding project felt rewarding. While it was not as complex as other coders' work, we had to all start somewhere. Going through the basic functions of how C++ worked and how the GitHub website worked along with the idea of how to clone a git repository were eye opening experiences for what was to come in the future. In this lab we ran with the basics of coding and how to write it properly and how to check if it worked. It was like being hired for a job and on the first day of work you are given a rundown of how everything works and by the next week they let you be, and it is your time to shine. 

* Lab 11 

Lab 11, Part 2 was one of the more challenging coding projects we had to complete throughout the semester. The goal here was to create a guessing game. For example, if the number was 10 but the user guessed 3 you will tell them number is too small and 4 guesses left. The game would end once the user had no more tries or if they guessed the number correctly. It was something to keep in mind because we created some type of game and now if you think about the bigger games such as in the video game industry the amount of work, they must put in to have a functional game is quite the achievement. Here we used previous knowledge from other labs to create our game such as we used if else statement, bool statements, while statements. We were also able to read out statements using std::cout to tell the user if they had won or lost or how many guesses they had left. We brought different functions that when put together work well. For me it was the smaller stuff I saw and how they function because I have never coded before in the past and while I was learning I found everything amazing within the industry.
